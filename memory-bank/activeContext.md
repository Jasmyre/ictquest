# Active Context — ICTQuest

Execution spec: #23 (source of truth). Decisions frozen in `docs/adr/0001–0009`.

## Current focus

Design-system + `/` polish (uncommitted): `docs/design-system.md` created —
page shell, header, tokens, cards/grids, motion, states derived from
`/lessons` + `/social` with `/` as canonical; `/` stats gain stagger
(50ms) + `cubic-bezier(0.23,1,0.32,1)` hover lift. Gates: typecheck clean,
ultracite fix applied, progress-stats 8/8.
Next: push the stack to `origin/main` (`git push`).

## Open questions

- DB split: create the `DATABASE_URL` secret + `production` environment in
  GitHub repo settings before the first merge to `main` triggers `deploy-prod`;
  decide whether to also set a shared `DATABASE_URL_DEV` for the team.

## Vocabulary delta

- Six entities: Lesson, Topic, Quiz (standalone), Progress, Achievement, User.
  `Post` dropped; Compliments is a page only.
- route group = URL-invisible layout bucket; shell = per-group layout chrome;
  guard = `proxy.ts` + `routes.ts` rule.
- Testing: externally visible behavior at the highest seam possible; never
  implementation details (spec #23).
